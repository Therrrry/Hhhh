The Infineon TLE7182EM is a specialized gate driver IC for H-Bridge motor control, ensuring efficient and precise operation. It drives four MOSFETs (two high-side, two low-side) using an integrated bootstrap circuit for reliable high-side switching. The IC supports PWM control for speed and torque regulation while preventing shoot-through with built-in dead-time control. Its ISENSE pin enables real-time current monitoring for overcurrent protection and adaptive torque control. Diagnostic features (ERR, DIS) enhance reliability by detecting faults like overtemperature and undervoltage. The TLE7182EM enables multiple motor control modes, including forward, reverse, braking, and freewheeling. A robust charge pump ensures continuous high-side operation at low PWM duty cycles, making it ideal for automotive and industrial applications. With a 1.5A current drive and high-frequency PWM support, it enhances efficiency, reduces losses, and ensures smooth operation in motor-driven systems like power steering, robotics, and automated machinery.
