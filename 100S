The designed H-Bridge motor control system using the Infineon TLE7182EM ensures efficient and reliable operation with integrated MOSFET gate driving, current sensing, and fault protection. A 24V power supply with decoupling capacitors stabilizes the circuit, while bootstrap capacitors facilitate high-side MOSFET switching. The microcontroller (TC3X series) communicates via SPI, controlling IH1, IL1, IH2, and IL2 signals for bidirectional motor control. A shunt resistor-based current sensing mechanism (ISN/ISP) provides real-time monitoring and overcurrent protection. The ERR pin detects faults, enhancing safety. This robust design supports forward, reverse, braking, and freewheeling modes, ensuring efficient and precise motor operation in automotive and industrial applications.
