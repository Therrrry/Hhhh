The Infineon SAK-TC37x microcontroller is used for H-bridge motor control in automotive applications, enabling bidirectional motor operation via SPI communication, GPIO handling, and real-time monitoring. The IHX and ILX input pins control switching, while the IGXP and IDC output pins drive the H-bridge power stage. The GPIO pins manage general control functions, status monitoring, and interfacing with external components.

For fault detection and protection, the ERR pin detects overcurrent, undervoltage, or overheating, triggering a safe shutdown, while the SCDL pin identifies short circuits to prevent damage. The ENA pin enables or disables the H-bridge, ensuring controlled operation. The VSS pin provides a stable ground reference.

The ISO pin functions as a current sensor, allowing real-time current monitoring, which helps in adaptive control, overcurrent protection, and performance optimization. The RPP pin protects against reverse polarity, preventing system damage from incorrect power connections.

SPI communication between the microcontroller and the H-bridge driver enables real-time speed adjustments, direction control, and fault reporting. PWM signals generated by the GTM module regulate motor speed and torque, while a dead-time mechanism prevents shoot-through faults.

The system integrates watchdog timers and emergency stop functions, ensuring safe and efficient motor control. The combination of SPI-based control, PWM switching, current sensing, and fault detection makes this H-bridge implementation highly reliable for automotive applications, delivering efficient, precise, and robust performance.
