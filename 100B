The block diagram illustrates an H-Bridge motor control system using the Infineon TLE7182EM gate driver, interfaced with a TC3X series microcontroller via SPI. The 24V DC power supply provides power to both the microcontroller and the H-Bridge. The microcontroller generates control signals (IH1, IL1, IH2, IL2) to determine the switching state of the MOSFETs inside the TLE7182EM. The PWM input regulates motor speed, while the ERR pin reports faults. The motor, connected to OUT1 and OUT2, operates in forward, reverse, braking, or freewheeling mode. This setup ensures efficient and precise DC motor control with real-time diagnostics.
